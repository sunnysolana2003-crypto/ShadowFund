## Tweet 1 (Hook)

I just built the first AI-managed, privacy-preserving hedge fund on Solana.

It uses @GoogleAI Gemini for strategy and @AnonRADR ShadowWire for ZK privacy.

Here's how ShadowFund works 🧵👇

## Tweet 2 (The Problem)

The problem with DeFi today:

→ Every transaction is public
→ Whales see your trades and front-run you
→ Competitors copy your strategy instantly
→ Your alpha dies the moment it hits the chain

Transparency is a double-edged sword.

---

## Tweet 3 (The Solution)

ShadowFund solves this with a simple thesis:

**Transparent reasoning. Invisible execution.**

• AI explains WHY it's allocating your funds
• ZK proofs hide HOW MUCH is moving
• Your strategy stays private. Your edge stays intact.

---

## Tweet 4 (USD1 Integration)

At the core: @AnonRADR's USD1 stablecoin

Not just "supported" — it's THE unit of account:

• Deposit USD1 → shielded balance
• All 4 vaults denominate in USD1
• Swaps return profits as USD1
• Withdrawals return USD1

Privacy-first money for privacy-first DeFi.

## Tweet 5 (4-Vault Architecture)

The architecture: 4 vaults, 4 risk levels

🔵 RESERVE — Pure USD1 (safe haven)
🟢 YIELD — Kamino lending (5-15% APY)
🟡 GROWTH — SOL, RADR, ORE via Jupiter
🔴 DEGEN — Memecoins (BONK, JIM, POKI)

AI allocates based on real-time market data + your risk profile.

## Tweet 6 (AI Strategy)

The brain: Google Gemini 3 Flash

Every allocation decision:
1. Fetches SOL price, RSI, volatility
2. Sends context to Gemini AI
3. Gets allocation + reasoning
4. Enforces risk caps
5. Executes via ShadowWire

You see the logic. Competitors see nothing.

## Tweet 7 (Position Persistence)

Plot twist: Positions are stored ON-CHAIN

Using Solana's Memo Program:
```
SHADOWFUND|growth|open|SOL|0.5|145.20|...
```

• No database needed
• Survives server restarts
• Works across devices
• Fully verifiable on Solscan

True Web3. Not Web2.5.

## Tweet 8 (Tech Stack)

Tech stack for the nerds:

Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind v4
Backend: Next.js API (Vercel)
AI: Gemini 3 Flash
Privacy: ShadowWire SDK v1.1.15
DeFi: Kamino + Jupiter
Chain: Solana

Full TypeScript. Non-custodial. Production-ready.

---

## Tweet 9 (Non-Custodial)

Important: ShadowFund is 100% non-custodial

• YOU connect YOUR wallet
• YOU sign every transaction
• Backend builds TX → you approve
• No server wallet holds your funds

Your keys. Your funds. Your vaults.

---

## Tweet 10 (Solo Build)

Built this solo for the @AnonRADR hackathon.

What started as "can I integrate ShadowWire?" became:

✅ 4-vault architecture
✅ AI strategy engine
✅ Kamino yield farming
✅ Jupiter token swaps
✅ On-chain position tracking
✅ Non-logging privacy policy

Sleep is overrated anyway.

---

## Tweet 11 (What's Next)

What's next for ShadowFund:

1. Mainnet deployment with real USD1
2. Multi-token shielding
3. Social copy-trading (private)
4. DAO governance for strategies
5. Mobile app

DeFi should be private by default, not by exception.

---

## Tweet 12 (CTA)

Want to try it?

GitHub: github.com/sunnysolana2003-crypto/ShadowFund

The code is open. The architecture is production-ready.

If you believe privacy is a right, not a feature — let's build together.

DMs open for collabs. 🤝

## OPTIONAL: Quote Tweet for Engagement

"Most DeFi projects optimize for transparency.

ShadowFund optimizes for selective transparency.

Show the reasoning. Hide the execution.

That's the alpha."
