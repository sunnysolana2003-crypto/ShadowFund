# ShadowAgent - Final Demo Script (Hackathon Ready)

## 1. Introduction (30s)
"Hi, I'm [Name]. Today I'm presenting **ShadowAgent**, the first AI-managed, privacy-preserving hedge fund on Solana. 

In DeFi, your strategy is your edge. But on-chain, every move is public. ShadowAgent fixes this by combining **Google Gemini AI** with the **ShadowWire ZK-Privacy layer**. We offer transparent AI reasoning with private, zero-log execution."

## 2. The Entry Flow (1m)
**[Action: Open Landing Page]**
"Our landing page sets the tone: **Invisible DeFi Yields**. When a user enters, they don't just connect a wallet; they enter a production-ready environment."

**[Action: Click Connect Wallet]**
"Our system is production-ready. While we are currently running in **Simulation Mode** for this demo to ensure a flawless presentation without risking real capital, the entire **ShadowWire SDK v1.1.15** is fully integrated and ready for mainnet deployment with a single configuration change."

## 3. The Dashboard & AI (2m)
**[Action: Connect Wallet]**
"Once inside, the dashboard shows the power of the fund. We have a **4-Vault Architecture**: Reserve, Yield, Growth, and Degen. 

The 'brain' of the fund is here: **AI Strategy**. This is a **LIVE call to Gemini 3 Flash**. It analyzes real-time Solana market signals—RSI, volatility, and meme hype—to recommend the perfect allocation. It doesn't just give numbers; it gives **transparent reasoning**."

## 4. The Privacy Highlight (1.5m)
**[Action: Navigate to Technology Page]**
"This is our most important section. ShadowAgent is built on a **Zero-Log Policy**. 

We use **Deterministic PDAs**—what we call 'Ghost Architecture'. Your vaults aren't just accounts; they are manifested from the void using ZK-seeds derived from your signature. There are no databases storing your balances. 

Our **USD1 integration** is the ultimate highlight. Fund movements are shielded using ZK-Bulletproofs, ensuring that while the AI's logic is transparent, your specific execution is invisible to front-runners."

## 5. Mainnet Readiness (1m)
**[Action: Toggle 'Show Audit Details' on Tech Page]**
"For the judges: we are mainnet-ready. Our audit shows real integration with the **Kamino Klend-SDK** and **Jupiter's Swap API**. 

We are currently running a high-fidelity simulation for the ZK-relayer because of devnet mint whitelisting, but as you can see in our codebase, the **ShadowWire SDK v1.1.15** is fully integrated. Flipping one environment variable takes this fund from demo to live production."

## 6. Conclusion (30s)
"ShadowAgent is institutional-grade finance for the sovereign individual. Private, Intelligent, and Non-Custodial. 

Thank you, and I'm ready for your questions."
